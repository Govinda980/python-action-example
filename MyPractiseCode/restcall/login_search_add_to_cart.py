Explanation of the Authorization Header
Authorization: The header key that tells the server youâ€™re providing credentials for access.
Bearer {token}: The format for token-based authentication, where Bearer indicates the type of token being used,
 followed by the actual token (in this case, token). The token is typically a unique string received from the server 
 after a successful login and serves as proof of identity.
